I'm a PhD student in topic of AI ethics and data governance. Funded by [SFI Centre for Research Training in Digitally-Enhanced Reality (D-REAL)](https://d-real.ie/). Based at [ADAPT - SFI Research Centre for Digital Media Technology](https://www.adaptcentre.ie/), at [School of Computer Science and Statistics, Trinity College Dublin](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/).
